Welcome to our RSS2EBOOK service! This is a convenient tool that automatically converts your subscribed articles into e-books and sends them to you via email. Recently, we added subscription source categorization and push configuration features to provide you with more personalized service.

Here are the steps to use our service:

#### Step 1: Register and login
Register and login on our website to become a member. By creating a personal account, you can easily manage your subscriptions and e-books. We guarantee the security and privacy of your personal information.

#### Step 2: Set push configuration and e-book format
In "Push Configuration," you can set the push method, e-book format, push time, and frequency. We support two e-book formats, epub and mobi, and you can choose the format you prefer. At the same time, you can adjust the push time and frequency according to your needs.

#### Step 3: Add and categorize subscription sources
You can add the subscription sources you are interested in by entering the source's RSS source URL. We support categorizing subscription sources, and you can add them to existing categories or create new ones. In each category, you can set the e-book name, the number of days to retain articles, and whether to save images in articles. Through the categorization function, you can better manage your subscription sources and e-books.

#### Step 4: Start receiving e-books
Once you have added and categorized your subscription sources, our system will automatically convert them into e-books and push them to your email according to your push configuration. If you subscribe to a large number of sources, you can create multiple categories, and each category will generate an e-book. Without manual organization, you can easily read the articles you are interested in.

#### Step 5: Manage your subscriptions and e-books
In your personal account, you can view the subscription sources you have added, the e-books you have received, and the categories you have created. You can also edit push configuration and e-book format, as well as the settings of each category. We also provide some tools to help you manage and export your subscription sources and e-books.

By using our RSS2EBOOK service, you can read the articles you are interested in anytime, anywhere, and never miss any exciting content. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us.
